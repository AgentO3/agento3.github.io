### Incrementing blog posts for 7 weeks

I'm a really passionate developer, I enjoy what I do, and I would like to share my thoughts with more people. By doing so I hope I will find others who share a similar perspective. I've tried a couple of times over the years to get into blogging. However for whatever reason I just can't see to make blogging a routine.

### The Plan

So, to attempt to get into a regular blogging pattern I have come up with a plan. The idea is simple, every week for the next 7 weeks I will be obligated to post X blog articles. As each week passes the required number of posts will increase exponentially. Week 1 I will be required to write only one post. By week 7 will be obligated to write 7 blog pasts within that week. By the end of week 7 I will have written 28 within 7 weeks.

### Why?

I find it motivating to have a goal in mind. With an end result to focus on will help motivate me to keep focused on the task. I have never been a great writer. I find it hard to keep my thoughts organized while writing. I think the majority of this problem is due to the fact I don't write enough. So if I ever hope to improve I need to write more.
